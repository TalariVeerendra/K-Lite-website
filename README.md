This project is a K-Lite–inspired website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to closely mimic the layout, style, and user experience of the original K-Lite website. The goal of the project is to recreate a clean, lightweight, and user-friendly interface that showcases essential information, download options, and product details in a simple and intuitive way.

The site features:

A responsive and minimalistic UI similar to the official K-Lite design

Recreated sections such as product descriptions, download buttons, and support/info pages

Custom CSS styling to match the look and feel of the original website

JavaScript enhancements for interactivity and smooth navigation

This project serves as a front-end practice exercise for replicating real-world website designs and improving skills in web layout, styling, and vanilla JavaScript interactions.
